### Brief History

The Fibonacci Sequence was founded by Leonardo Bonacci. The name Fibonacci was given to him by Franco-Italian historian Guillaume Libri and is short for filius Bonacci ('son of Bonacci'). The Fibonacci sequence appears in the book The Book of Calculation by Fibonacci where it is used to calculate the growth of rabbit populations. Fibonacci considers the growth of a rabbit population, assuming that: a newly born breeding pair of rabbits are put in a field; each breeding pair mates at the age of one month, and at the end of their second month they always produce another pair of rabbits; and rabbits never die, but continue breeding forever. Fibonacci posed the puzzle: how many pairs will there be in one year? 

- At the end of the first month, they mate, but there is still only 1 pair.
- At the end of the second month they produce a new pair, so there are 2 pairs in the field.
- At the end of the third month, the original pair produce a second pair, but the second pair only mate to gestate for a month, so there are 3 pairs in all.
- At the end of the fourth month, the original pair has produced yet another new pair, and the pair born two months ago also produces their first pair, making 5 pairs.

At the end of the nth month, the number of pairs of rabbits is equal to the number of mature pairs (that is, the number of pairs in month n – 2) plus the number of pairs alive last month (month n – 1). The number in the nth month is the nth Fibonacci number.
